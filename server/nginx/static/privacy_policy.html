        Shifu Life Consultants Privacy Policy<br>
        Last Modified: April 23, 2019<br>
        <br><br>
        Our Services help students complete the essays in their college or
        graduate-school applications. For example, any registered user of Shifu Life Consultants
        can purchase Services, and provide information to be included in their
        essays.
        <br><br>
        This Privacy Policy describes how and when we collect, and use your
        information across our website. When using any of our Services you
        consent to the collection, transfer, storage, and use of your
        information as described in this Privacy Policy. This includes any
        information you choose to provide that is deemed sensitive under
        applicable law.
        <br><br>
        When this policy mentions “we” or “us,” it refers to the controller of
        your information under this policy. Despite this, you alone control and
        are responsible for the information you submit through the Survey of the
        Services, as provided in the Terms of Service.

        <br><br>
        <a id="hili">Basic Account Information</a>
        <br>
        If you choose to create a Shifu Life Consultants account, you
        must provide us with some personal information, such as your name,
        username, password, and email address. On Shifu Life Consultants, your username is not
        listed publicly. You can create and manage multiple Shifu Life Consultants accounts.
        <br><br>
        <a id="hili">Contact Information</a>
        <br>
        You may use your email address and WeChat as your
        contact information. We may use your contact information to send you
        requests for more information regarding your application essays, and
        send you the application essays that we help you write.
        <br><br>
        <a id="hili">Additional Information</a>
        <br>
        You must provide us with additional information
        to help write your application essays. For example, you must answer the
        required questions in the survey so that we can help you write your
        academic background in your Personal Statement. We will store the information you provide in the Survey till we complete the Services. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address, and contact information to respond to your request.
        <br><br>
        <a id="hili">Using Our Services<a>
        <br>
        We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our Services, even if you have not created an account (“Log Data”). For example, when you visit our website, sign in our website, and purchase Services, we may receive information about you. This Log Data may include your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms, or cookie information. We also receive Log Data when you click on, view or interact with links on our Services. We use Log Data to make inferences, like what Services you may be interested in. We keep Log Data as needed for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, email address, or phone number, after a maximum of 18 months, if not sooner.

        <a id="subsec">Information Sharing and Disclosure</a>
        <br><br>
        <a id="hili">User Consent or Direction</a>
        <br>
        We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. If you’ve shared information, like Profile information and Survey information with another person or organization through a third-party service, keep in mind that the information may be shared with the third-party service.
        <br><br>
        <a id="hili">Law and Harm<a>
        <br>
        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
        in this Privacy Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information
        if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law,
        regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the
        safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues;
        or to protect our or our users’ rights or property. However, nothing
        in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or
        objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a
        government’s, request to disclose your information.
        <br><br>
        <a id="hili">Changes to this Policy<a>
        <br>
        We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current
        version of the policy will govern our use of your information. By
        continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become
        effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
